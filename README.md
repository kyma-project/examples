# Examples

## Overview

The examples project provides a central repository to showcase and illustrate features and concepts on Kyma.

### What an example is

- An example is a small demo that illustrates a particular feature or concept of Kyma.
- An example refers to full, ready-to-use application development requiring no explanation.
- An example must be concise and clear.

### What an example is not

- An example cannot be a lecture or tutorial that guides the user through the topic with steps. Tutorials are part of the product documentation.
- An example is not a production-ready application or service. Do not use examples in a production environment.
